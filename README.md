# The-Haunted-Tomb
Game in Unity (KGR)


The game in question was developed within the ambit of the Computer Graphics course. It was created using the Unity game engine and programmed in C#. The objective of the game is to venture into an archaic tomb and procure an elusive treasure that has been long lost. The tomb is designed as a labyrinthine structure, which can easily disorientate the player. Furthermore, hostile mummies are strategically placed within the tomb to impede the player's progress. The game comprises multiple levels that are progressively more challenging than the previous one. Upon successfully stealing the treasure, the player is afforded the opportunity to augment their abilities, including but not limited to speed, health, and weapon strength, via the in-game shop
